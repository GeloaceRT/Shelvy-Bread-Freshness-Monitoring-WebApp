# TODO

- [x] Implement mock telemetry service and React context to broadcast live sensor readings and device status across the dashboard.
- [x] Replace static data in `src/components/HomePage.jsx`, `src/components/DashBoard.js`, and related monitoring pages with telemetry-driven values.
- [x] Generate simulated alerts/log history and document the feature in `README.md` once the mock telemetry is in place.
- [x] Run the existing test suite (`npm test`) to confirm the dashboard still passes after telemetry integration.
